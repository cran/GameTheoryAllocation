Description: Many situations can be modeled as game theoretic situations. Some procedures are included in this package to calculate the most important allocations rules in Game Theory: Shapley value, Owen value or nucleolus, among other. First, we must define as an argument the value of the unions of the envolved agents with the characteristic function.
